*Amazon-SageMaker-high-level-Python-library.ipynb* demonstrtes how to set up a workspace in Cloud9 then read in a *csv* file as input to train a linear model.

*kmeans_mnist.ipynb* shows how to read a pickle input file from a S3 bucket and perform a cluster analysis using the K-Means model. This model is then deployed to an EC2 instance for inference.

*xgboost_customer_churn.ipynb* uses the customer churn data in the UC Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Datasets to train a Xgboost model. It starts with EDA to examine the data distribution and explore possible correlation between them.
